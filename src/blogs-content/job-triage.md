Searching for jobs is exhausting. We may have to constantly prepare for the interview questions, apply around 20 companies every day, have multiple interviews with different companies, and of course constantly facing rejections. The best way to reduce this pain is by organizing your job search.  Not only it will make job search easy but it will have a soothing effect. 

Remember the time when you organize your laptop by deleting unnecessary files and arranging your folders etc. How does it feel? Exactly! That's what I am talking about. Organizing things have always been a meditation for humans. And I thought we can apply the same to job search

**TLDR**: Check out [JobTriage](https://github.com/jobtriage/jobtriage) - an interactive way to manage your job applications


# JobTriage
JobTriage is the new open-source project for managing your job search. It is indeed an interactive way to manage and track your job applications with a **kanban board**. In this post, I will discuss the features and some important components of the job search.

## Triage

Triage is the process of determining the priority of patient's treatments based on the severity of their condition. This rations patient treatment efficiently when resources are insufficient for all to be treated immediately, influencing the order and priority of emergency treatment, emergency transport, or transport destination for the patient.

JobTriage lets you add job applications along with priority(high, medium, low). You can add notes, time log for each application, and prepare your interviews according to its priority.

## Self-analysis

 Self-analysis is very important and simple yet we fail to give importance. It should be given the same weightage to that of technical interviews. I will discuss some basic components of self-analysis.

### Personal pitch
"Tell me about yourself" - The most daunting question asked in an interview. You are with you for the entire life and suddenly you know nothing about yourself. Lack of practice is the main reason for this problem.

Personal pitch is something you say to sell yourself under 60 seconds. An ideal personal / Elevator pitch should be in 60 seconds, with most of the part covering your academic and work experiences and highlights in your career.

- It should be small and precise
- Practice it regularly
- Modify your pitch a little based on the interview

### Behaviour analysis

**STAR stories**
It is a method to construct your answers in an organized way. The answers should follow this pattern:

- Situation
- Task
- Action
- Results

Some example questions are
- Tell me your hardest challenge
- What was the most stressful situation you have faced?
- When is the last time you had to introduce a new idea or procedure to people on this job? How did you do it?
- Tell us about the setbacks you have faced. How did you deal with them?

**Traditional and cultural fit questions:** These are very common questions asked in an interview.
- What are your strengths and weakness?
- How do you keep up with current trends and advances in the field?
- What is your ideal job?
- What is your ideal company?

**How job triage can help ?**. Well, it can't prepare a pitch for you but you can add your pitch and stories in the platform, improve and practice it constantly. We are going old school here. If you write it, you remember it better.
